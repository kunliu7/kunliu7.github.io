My name is Kun Liu, a Ph.D. student at Yale University advised by Prof. [Yongshan Ding](https://www.yongshanding.com/).
Prior to that, I obtained my Master's degree at Carnegie Mellon University and Bachelor's degree at Tongji University.

I am currently interested in Quantum Error Correction and Quantum Computing Architecture.
